  <h1>Your ISP is not Net-Neutral!</h1>
  <p>Unfortunately, your Internet Service Provider is attempting to break the web. It is violating one of the
  core tenants of a free and open web by not treating data on the internet equally. This principle is called
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">Net Neutrality</a>. Violating net neutrality threatens
  the entire web. Since your ISP has chosen not to be net-neutral, we are blocking access to this site when 
  requested through your current ISP.</p>
  
  <p>To access this website, please switch to a net-neutral ISP.</p>

// all access to the net, or you can provide a "degraded" experience by simply blocking all CSS include
// files, so that content is still delivered, but styling is only provided to net-neutral ISPs.
