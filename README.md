neutrality-enforcer
===================

Block or degrade access to your site from non-net-neutral ISPs.

==
If ISPs do not want to participate in the neutral, open web, that is their perogative. If you think that such ISPs do not deserve to be a part of the web any longer, it is your perogative to block access to your site, or provide a degraded user experience (e.g. disabling all CSS). 

This code will detect bad ISPs and give you the option to block out all or some content as well as providing a message. 

Please fork and improve!
