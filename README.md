neutrality-enforcer
===================

Block or degrade access to your site from non-net-neutral ISPs.

So far, this code is just a starting point (though you should be able to use it). Please fork and write your own or help improve this one!
==
If ISPs do not want to participate in the neutral, open web, that is their perogative. It is the perogative of the open web to exclude non-net-neutral ISPs from the internet completely. 

This code will detect bad ISPs and give you the option to block out all or some content as well as providing a message. 

Please fork and improve!
